U.S. State Guessing Game
A Python-based interactive game where users guess the names of U.S. states. The guessed states are dynamically written on a map and saved to a CSV file for later review.

Features
Displays a map of the United States.
Allows users to input and guess state names.
Writes correctly guessed state names at their respective coordinates on the map.
Tracks guessed states and prevents duplicate entries.
Saves the list of guessed states to a CSV file.


Prerequisites
Python: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
Turtle Graphics: Comes built-in with Python, no additional installation required.
pandas=pip install pandas

Setup
Clone or download the repository.
Place your map image file (e.g., bs.gif) in the project directory.
Ensure the 50_states.csv file is present in the project directory. This file should contain:
A state column listing all 50 U.S. state names.
x and y columns indicating the coordinates of each state on the map

The game will display a map and prompt you to guess state names.
Type the name of a state into the input box and press "OK":
Correct guesses will be displayed on the map.
To exit the game, type "Exit."
At the end of the game, a file named guessed_states.csv will be generated containing all the correctly guessed states.

Future Improvements
Add a timer for competitive play.
Display remaining states on the map at the end of the game.
Include a scoring system based on accuracy and speed.
